## Understanding the Basics

### XP System

**XP (Experience Points)** are the currency of XP Tracker. You earn XP by completing habits and tasks.

- **Habits**: Repeating daily activities (e.g., "Morning Meditation", "Exercise")
- **Tasks (Missions)**: One-off or project-based goals with deadlines
- **XP Rewards**: Each habit and task has an XP value you earn on completion
- **Levels**: Every 200 XP, you level up and unlock new achievements

### Streaks

A **streak** is the number of consecutive days you've completed a habit.

- **Streak Counter**: Shows 🔥 (fire) when active, ❄️ (frozen) when no streak
- **Losing a Streak**: Missing even one day breaks it and resets to 0
- **Streak Notifications**: You'll get encouraged via email at milestones (5 days, 10 days, etc.) and when you miss a day

### Ranks

As you level up, you gain a **Rank**. Ranks are displayed on your Profile:

- 🌱 **Novice** (Level 1-4)
- 🗡️ **Squire** (Level 5-9)
- 🛡️ **Knight** (Level 10-19)
- 👑 **Champion** (Level 20-49)
- 🐉 **Legend** (Level 50+)

## Tips & Best Practices

### 🎯 Building Habits

1. **Start small**: Habits with lower XP rewards (20-30 XP) are easier to build consistently
2. **Stack habits**: Do similar habits together (meditation → journaling)
3. **Use streaks as motivation**: The streak counter is powerful — don't break it!
4. **Review weekly**: Check your **📊 Reports** every Sunday to reflect

### 📈 Maximizing XP

1. **Complete daily habits**: Consistent daily completion = most reliable XP
2. **Add high-value tasks**: Tasks can be worth 100+ XP for big projects
3. **Aim for level-ups**: Each level up = achievement + potential badge
4. **Check Leaderboard**: Friendly competition keeps you engaged

### 💌 Using Coaching

1. **Read your notifications**: They're personalized and contain actionable advice
2. **Save wisdom**: When you get a great piece of advice, paste it in your **📔 Journal**
3. **Re-read when stuck**: Use Notification History to find past encouragement

### 🤝 Using Leaderboard

1. **Find your peer group**: See who's at your level
2. **Learn from the top**: Check what habits top performers have
3. **Celebrate others**: Comment or celebrate teammates' wins (if in same org)
